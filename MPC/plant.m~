function zNext = plant(arm)
% This function solves the nonlinear equations of motion of an arm model
% (over a single time step) using MATLAB's variable-step-size numerical
% integrator 'ode45'. It updates the arm properties and outputs the
% augmented state vector (as required for this function to be used in the
% unscented Kalman filter for state estimation).
